I've got an assignment to build a term project that use database. Well, it's an *easy* task just to reuse my old projects. So why not implement some idea that waiting to surface?

The fun part is, I've completely forget that the project would require a lot of illustrations. Good luck that I have a passion for it. I'm on fire! (but not too much to burnout.)

So here is the first draft on the paper.

IIRC, it's done in-class for just half an hour. Maybe a little bit longer since I had drawn it twice -- first one is too messy spaghetti lines, well it's on the paper so no drag-drop lol.

My original plan is to scan and just use it as-is. But then I realize that these icons must have both black-white and color mode. Drawing with mouse on Gimp / Inkscape don't work. So I have to return to a pen.. a stylus! Lucky that I can borrow iPad to draw it via MyScript Memo app (too bad that the source file is gone for good).

If you find that these icons are any good, take it and use it anywhere you want! Just give me a credit and ping me where you've used ðŸ˜‰
