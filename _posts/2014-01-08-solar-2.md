Bad mission design ever. Some stage is too hard to figure out how to beat. Even knew how, then you may need incredible precise timing, and 99% luck to get through it! Seems like creators team only thought "what seems challenge to put into this game?", and in all of them; without game testers who play this game to ensure almost every mission is hard enough and still fun for us.

"Fun for me at last", the god alien repeat this like 1000 times, when I die, in just one mission. Yeah, it just only fun for you, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s left for the rest of us.

Really hate the god alien.
