⚠️ Caution: if you want a detective story that piece everything together for you at the end, looks elsewhere. ⚠️

Tangle Tower is a great detective game: art, music, voice over, mechanic, etc. The world setting is a little bit fantasy but still quite similar to ours. The story is actually good and coherence. However the ending might not be favorable for some players because ~~the murderer got away~~ and also leaves many question unanswered. Which, if you're into detective genre, I bet you can connect the dot anyway. And I think that's actually a good sign for detective story that nudge you to think over it, even after the game has ended, instead of give away everything.
