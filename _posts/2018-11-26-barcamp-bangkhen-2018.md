Another weekend for another BarCamp to attended, and yesterday was BarCamp Bangkhen 9, which held annually at Kasetsart University.

Planned a reunion with [@taneekpet][] for months (since [TechJam][self techjam]), I ditch the morning sessions for [@ponearz][]'s death anniversary (and catch up with [@IamDao][] and [@scomma][] first). So I can't say much about the talk or lunch break. But seeing a list of sessions online suggest that this BarCamp is just yet another tech-savvy [*~~un~~*conference][unconference].

For me, BarCamp never meant to be just for tech talks. It should be an event that gathering various kinds of people with a wide range of interests. So we can show our passion and build stronger interest-based community afterward.

Except for my very first BarCamps (which I have to admit that I seize the opportunity to build up my profile), I stop proposing tech topic ever since. Cause I already know the community to share these interest already.

Over half a decade, these are my non-tech topics that I've put on the vote:

1. Tetris
2. Classical music
3. How to give a talk
4. Randomness
5. Maths art
6. LEGO

Out of six topics within six different areas, only one was selected. And I bet everyone can guess it, right?[^1]

So I'm a little disappointed that my latest LEGO topic wasn't elected, again. But then it's kind of a relief since I haven't made the slide, yet. And if this trend of rejection continues on, maybe I'll drop out the preparation to give a talk too, then speak the details that've come to my mind as [@5argon][] do!

I know that I can initiate a *ghost* room to host my own session (for my friends), but then how to know someone new who's also interested in my topic? Actually, it doesn't have to be a talk right there in the event at all. What matter the most is how to expand the circle. And every participant deserved it, not only the one who gets voted.

Maybe we have to disturb the very fundamental of this event again?

By the way, great to see everyone again, which include, but not limited to: [@ipats][], [@Choestelus][], [@bact][], [@ratitada][], [@awkwin][], [@dtinth][], [@nrad6949][], [@LXZE][]. And thanks for a very special after party caffeine-free session na @taneekpet and @5argon ☕🥤🥛.

[^1]: It's a topic about *computer* game!
