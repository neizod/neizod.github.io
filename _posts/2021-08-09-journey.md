OH. MY. GOD.

I've play this game blindingly, knowing only that my friends strongly recommend it (since PS3). So I thought that the in-game companion is just a very well trained AI that respond to my movements and my "singing" ability. Thus, I've play the game at my own pace: flying, surfing, exploring, meditating, "talking" with my companion. Well, the journey do means something to me, but I doubt that it might not means anything to my companion since I thought there were AI. Still, I try to treat them as well as I can since I think it is the right thing to do, even for an AI.

However, when the credit roll, I saw that there's no AI anywhere. My companion is actually a real person sitting behind a computer somewhere in the world! Despite our destination are determined, but the silly and brilliant things along the journey made it so special. And I fall in love with every moments. And although this seems to be one-in-a-lifetime experience and we might never met again. But thank you @Vicann for a wonderful journey with me!
