Immortality is a good movie. A great one. Even considering in tandem with gaming aspect, I'd still give it like 8/10... Maybe even 9/10.

But then Steam ask if I would recommend it or not (not asking for score or even if I just like it). So I have a hard time weighing pros and cons. And the conclusion is no, I'm leaning to the side that NOT recommending the game.

My pain points of this game are the mechanic of the game itself. The first impression is a bad design tutorial. Like, dumping ALL information on how to control the game at once. Which confuses me a lot since it starts with the complete footage of all clips in the movie just to teach me how to move left-right-up-down and zoom in and out over those clips, just to hide all of those footage later and left me finding them.

Well, if you gonna dump the tutorial that way, maybe use another set of example clips and let us explore freely without restriction? Like, looking at a physical card game series Unlock! (2017-) that have a few dedicate cards for the tutorial.

Next pain point is that it's so tedious to find all clips. Yes we can guess the overall story with like only 80% of the clips revealed. Finding all clips is just for those completionist. But hay, that's a huge gap between not knowing where to look results in missing something, and knowing exactly what to do but still missing something since luck play a huge role. The former may sometime gives players a-ha moments even though they look up for solutions. While the later only yield annoyance. Very disappointed with this design.

And lastly, the secret. Well, huge applause that I'm made aware of the secret by replaying the sex scene multiple times (human after all ðŸ¤·). But it's only a silhouette of another reality I'm experiencing, not the real secret. To actually submerged into the secret requires a not-so-obvious instruction to activates it. On one hand, yes, secrets meant to be hidden this way to prevent activating accidentally. But then on the other hand, the mechanic to activates the secret is so inconsistent. Sometimes I can completely go into the secret with other relative instructions (when I'm not aware of the "right" way), and other time I just can't. That's dangerous. It leads me to a false assumption that some secrets offer full detailed narration, while the other just a glimpse with silhouette. It wasn't waaaaay later when I gave up and look for solutions to realize that those silhouettes are meant to be full narrated, the silhouettes happen because I've failed to activates the secret completely! So now I have the whole game to watch again, hunting just for secrets. Super tedious. And it outweigh all the good parts I've experienced.
