Sadly I have to say no to this "game".

The hyperbolic geometry is fascinating. But that's about all.

Because quests in game are not fun.

In the restaurant area where player have to serve quickly. The game practically assist nothing to help this task. Yes it show a target icon to the next table. But if the player facing other direction, there's no way to tell where's the next target (an arrow at the edge of screen pointing toward the direction of the next target would be nice). Actually, there is no serving order, so the player may plan the shortest route to serve all orders (instead of moving around inefficiently pointing to the next target shown by the game). But the game really have no concept of this planning: stop the time before the quest start, look at a map and pan around, show multiple target with distances.

In the farm area where player have to shoot beavers. It's so tedious to hit a beaver. It is ok that standing somewhat close to the beaver and shoot make them scare and hide. But I moved backward some distance to the point that the beaver is large over the horizon. Why shooting them at this stage still make them go hiding???

In the snow area where player have to do a snowball fight against NPCs. Not only the mechanic is clunky and tedious. The more important part is it is unfair, 3 vs 1. Each one (including the player) has 5 HP. JUST WHY??? This unfairness can be compensated with the player having 5 HP while others have 2 or 3 HP instead. That's not to the point of fair, but definitely more fair and more achievable.

And, guess what, all of these quests are mandatory to progress the story!

I really appreciate the mindblowing implementation of this weirdly unintuitive geometry. But honestly, speaking of it as a game, at least get a team with a game designer and play testers. They can help weeding out those unfun aspects off the game. Or if you're really tight on budget, the release the game as early-access to get a live feedback from actual players. Don't let the game fall into this stage of colorful limbo. (actually, go see the global achievement stat. there's only 1/4 players completing the game. that's really tell something.)
