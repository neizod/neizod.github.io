I am playing the whole game in accessibility mode. That is I cannot die, since I'm very bad at soul genre. So I cannot say if this game is good or bad in the combat aspect.

For the exploration (and puzzle), it's reminds me a lot of Zelda, Fez, Toki Tori 2+, Outer Wilds, Heaven's Vault. You piece up information piece by piece. Getting to know the world. Learn their weird language. Revealing their secrets. And finally, understand the touching story.

The puzzles are solid. The rules are clear and concise. And I really like that the developer truly know when to break the rule.

Such a masterpiece.
