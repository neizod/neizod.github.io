The puzzle itself is actually great, if not the best. However, I doubt that the immersive design might not work well with this genre (which might be wrong, since Outer Wilds done this part wonderfully).

Like, after solving a series of similar puzzles in the underground pyramid, I am now stuck with the very last one. Next to it is an elevator up to the surface, which only activates when all puzzles are solved. Should I temporary gave up on this one and backtrack to the surface to find other set of puzzles, then comes back to this one later? Nah, this design nudge me to search for a walkthrough on the internet instead; knowing that immersive walking around the island sucks, especially when there are no map to track anything or fast travel to jump anywhere.
