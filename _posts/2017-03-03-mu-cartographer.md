μ Cartographer is a puzzle game without tutorial AT ALL, so you either love it or hate it (like I used to, before I give it like a 5th chance). The objective is to use an equipment to search for treasures on map, which hidden under layers of right radio frequency.

After surpassing the frustration of no tutorial and getting hang of it, I find this game can be split into 3 fun phases:

1. Figure out how to use the equipment. How to navigate the map.
2. Figure out what, where, and how to find them.
3. Optimizing the process to find them more efficiently.

Now I can see that *IF* this game were giving tutorial, only last phase remaining, getting rid most of the fun. So it's will be logical to play this game without knowing anything in prior at all too. Let's the frustration sink in and experience EUREKA moments!

By the way, gaming experience will be much better with touchscreen and headphone (makes you feel like a sonar technician).
