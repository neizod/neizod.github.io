Born in 1989 at the dawn of the internet era, I spend my prehistoric time with *(too)* many mathematics books. Then embedded myself at [vcharkarn.com][], the only online Thai community at that time that discuss academia (no [pantip][] you're not). Later I switch to [blognone][] when my interest shift from math to com-sci. Just to find out years later that the two disciplines are actually one another in disguises!

The alias "‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏î" ([/n…§Àêjsot/][ipa], stylized in ascii as neizod) was picked, since I couldn't touch type back then. So when computer games prompt me to submit a new high score, I rush my fingers and hit return on the totally wrong keyboard layout without looking at the screen. Annoyed at first, but then I found that quite cool, so I adopted it with a little modification to made it readable.
